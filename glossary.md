# Python Course Glossary

## [Command V](#command-v)

'Command V' is a keyboard shortcut used to paste text. In Lesson 3, it's shown as a way to paste code into a Jupyter Notebook after copying it from the chatbot.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_3.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_3.txt)*

## [Control V](#control-v)

Control V (or Command V on Mac) is the keyboard shortcut for pasting text or code you copied to the clipboard. In Lesson 3, it's used to paste code from the chatbot into the coding environment so you can run it.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_3.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_3.txt)*

## [Jupyter Notebook](#jupyter-notebook)

A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding environment used for writing and running code, popular among programmers and data scientists. In Lesson 3, you learned how to paste code into it and execute with Shift + Enter.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_3.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_3.txt)*

## [Shift Enter](#shift-enter)

In Lesson 3, 'Shift Enter' is a key command in Jupyter Notebooks used to run a line of code. Just press and hold Shift, then hit Enter to execute the code. For example, typing `print("Hello, World!")` and pressing Shift Enter will display `Hello, World!` in the notebook.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_3.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_3.txt)*

## [argument](#argument)

An argument is the data you give to a function when you call it. For example, in Lesson 8, with `len("Hello World")`, `"Hello World"` is the argument given to the `len` function to calculate the string's length.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_8.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_8.txt)*

## [bug](#bug)

A bug in programming is an error or a mistake in the code that causes it to work incorrectly. For example, in Lesson 4, when a line of code had a typo, it didn't run as expected until the mistake was fixed.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_4.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_4.txt)*

## [coding environment](#coding-environment)

A coding environment is where you write and run your code. In Lesson 3, this is shown as a Jupyter Notebook, a popular tool for programmers and data scientists. You can write code, run it, and see the output all in one place.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_3.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_3.txt)*

## [comment](#comment)

In programming, a "comment" is text in your code that the computer ignores. It's often used to explain what the code does. In Python, comments start with a "#" symbol, like in Lesson 4: `# This is a comment`.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_4.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_4.txt)*

## [curly braces](#curly-braces)

Curly braces `{}` are used in Python's formatted strings (f-strings) to include calculations and variables within a string. For example, in f"Isabel is {28/7} dog years old", the curly braces let Python calculate the value inside them and insert it into the string. Learn more in Lesson 6.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_6.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_6.txt)*

## [def](#def)

'def' is used to define a function in Python. Functions let you create reusable blocks of code. For example, in the ‘Course Introduction’ lesson, you might use ‘def’ to create a function that prints a welcome message.

*Introduced in: [Course_Introduction.txt](path/to/video/Course_Introduction.txt)*

## [error message](#error-message)

An error message in programming tells you something went wrong with your code. In 'Lesson 4', for example, running buggy code shows an error message that helps you understand and fix the problem, often with the help of a chatbot.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_4.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_4.txt)*

## [f-string](#f-string)

F-strings are a way to format strings in Python. Introduced in Lesson 7, they let you embed variables directly into your string by using curly braces `{}`. For example, `f"Name: {name}"` will include the value of `name` in the output string.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_7.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_7.txt)*

## [floating-point formatting](#floating-point-formatting)

Floating-point formatting adjusts how decimal numbers are displayed. In Lesson 6, using formatted strings (f-strings), we can control this by specifying how many decimal places to show. For example, using `:.2f` displays a number with two decimal places, making output clear and readable.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_6.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_6.txt)*

## [function](#function)

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. It helps make your code more organized and efficient. For example, a function can calculate the sum of two numbers, which you can then use anytime you need that calculation in your program.

*Introduced in: [Course_Introduction.txt](path/to/video/Course_Introduction.txt)*

## [len()](#len-)

The `len()` function in Python calculates the number of characters in a string. For example, in Lesson 8, `len("Hello World")` returns 11. This function is useful for determining the length of strings, lists, and other collections.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_8.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_8.txt)*

## [loop](#loop)

A loop in programming lets you repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. For example, using a loop, you could print numbers 1 to 10 without writing 10 print statements. Loops make your code more efficient and help automate repetitive tasks.

*Introduced in: [Course_Introduction.txt](path/to/video/Course_Introduction.txt)*

## [print](#print)

The `print` function in Python displays information on the screen. For instance, in Lesson 7, typing `print(age)` will show the number 28 if `age` is set to 28. It helps visualize program output and debug.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_7.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_7.txt)*

## [print()](#print-)

The `print()` function in Python displays text or other output on the screen. For example, using `print("Hello, world!")` shows the text "Hello, world!" in the console. This basic function helps you see results of your code quickly. As introduced in 'Course Introduction', it’s fundamental for beginners.

*Introduced in: [Course_Introduction.txt](path/to/video/Course_Introduction.txt)*

## [prompt](#prompt)

A 'prompt' is the text or question you type into a chatbot to get a response. In Lesson 2, examples include "What is Python?" where the prompt leads the chatbot to generate an answer.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_2.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_2.txt)*

## [string](#string)

A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. For example, in "Lesson 4," the code `print("Hello, world")` uses the string "Hello, world" to display text on the screen. Strings are used to handle text data in your programs.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_4.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_4.txt)*

## [syntax](#syntax)

Syntax in programming refers to the set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs. In Lesson 2, we saw how Python's syntax, like using `print("Hello, World!")`, helps beginners start coding easily.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_2.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_2.txt)*

## [type()](#type-)

The `type()` function in Python tells you the data type of a given value. For example, in Lesson 5, `type("Hello world")` returns `str` indicating it's a string, while `type(100)` returns `int` indicating it's an integer.

*Introduced in: [Lesson_5.txt](path/to/video/Lesson_5.txt)*

## [variable](#variable)

A variable in Python is like a container that holds data. You can store numbers, text, or other values in it, and use it in your programs to perform tasks. For example, `x = 5` creates a variable named `x` that holds the number 5.

*Introduced in: [Course_Introduction.txt](path/to/video/Course_Introduction.txt)*

## [variable name](#variable-name)

A variable name is the label you give to a space in memory to store a value, like `age` in Lesson 7. Names must be unique, cannot have spaces, and are case-sensitive. For example, `age = 28` stores the number 28, which you can later use or change.
